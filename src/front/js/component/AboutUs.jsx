      <p className="text">
        Welcome to our journey of nutrition, empowerment, and self-love. We are a team of women
        who embarked on a mission to change the narrative around nutrition and body image. Our
        journey started from our own struggles and realizations that the path to wellness is not
        one-size-fits-all.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        We created this platform to be a haven for anyone looking to understand their body better,
        track their nutritional intake, and celebrate their progress, no matter how small. Our
        approach is rooted in the belief that every body is unique, and everyone's nutritional needs
        are different.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        Our goal is not just to provide a tool for tracking macros but to foster a community where
        everyone feels seen, heard, and supported. We advocate for body positivity, understanding
        that health and wellness come in all shapes and sizes. It's not about fitting into a
        mold—it's about breaking the mold and embracing your true self.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        Join us in this movement of nourishment, self-acceptance, and unconditional support. Let's
        celebrate each other's journeys and empower one another to live our healthiest, happiest
        lives.
      </p>
      <p className="signature">With love and positivity,<br />The Founders</p>
